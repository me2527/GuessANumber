In the second project, you have to create a game called Guess A Number. In this game:      A computer asks a player to think of a number between 1 and 63.      Then, the player is shown a series of 6 cards which contain some numbers.      The player then tells the computer (in the form of yes or no) whether the number they thought of exists on the card shown to them.      Based on the player responses to each of the 6 cards, the computer will return the number that the player thought of at the start of the game.  To get a better understanding of the game, play it using the link provided below.  https://www.mathsisfun.com/games/mind-reader.html
